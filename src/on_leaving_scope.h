/**
 * The contents of this file are based on the article posted at the
 * following location:
 *
 *   http://crascit.com/2015/06/03/on-leaving-scope-part-2/
 *
 * The material in that article has some commonality with the code made
 * available as part of Facebook's folly library at:
 *
 *   https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/ScopeGuard.h
 *
 * Furthermore, similar material is currently part of a draft proposal
 * to the C++ standards committee, referencing the same work by Andrei
 * Alexandresu that led to the folly implementation. The draft proposal
 * can be found at:
 *
 *   http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4189.pdf
 *
 * With the above in mind, the content below is made available under
 * the same license terms as folly to minimize any legal concerns.
 * Should there be ambiguity over copyright ownership between Facebook
 * and myself for any material included in this file, it should be
 * interpreted that Facebook is the copyright owner for the ambiguous
 * section of code concerned.
